# Digit Recognizer
This project gives a detailed analysis of a 
handwritten digit recognition system which is built using K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithms and logistic regression. 
The logistic regression model gives information on the likelihood 
that a given input will fall into a particular digit class.The KNN 
method effectively utilises the proximity of data points in feature 
space for categorization purposes. Throughout the project we 
compare these two models' performances on a dataset, showing 
the advantages and disadvantages of each model.

We used MNIST dataset as the main dataset for out project. The handwritten numbers (0–9) in 
grayscale are included in this dataset. The 42,000 handwritten 
digit samples in the dataset are represented by pixel values, 
which become features for the machine learning model. Each 
image's matching digit (0–9) is assigned by the output 
variable.
