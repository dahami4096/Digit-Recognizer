# Digit Recognizer
This project gives a detailed analysis of a 
handwritten digit recognition system which is built using K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithms and logistic regression. 
The logistic regression model gives information on the likelihood 
that a given input will fall into a particular digit class.The KNN 
method effectively utilises the proximity of data points in feature 
space for categorization purposes. Throughout the project we 
compare these two models' performances on a dataset, showing 
the advantages and disadvantages of each model.
